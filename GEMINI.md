# Gemini Collaboration Guidelines

This document outlines the development process we will follow, which is based on Kiro's Spec-Driven Development (SDD). This methodology ensures clarity, structure, and maintainability for all development tasks.

## Spec-Driven Development (SDD)

Our development process is centered around three key phases and their corresponding artifacts. For any given feature or task, we will create the following documents:

1.  **`requirements.md`**: This document will capture the project's needs using user stories and acceptance criteria. It will clearly define the "what" and "why" of a feature.

2.  **`design.md`**: This document will outline the technical blueprint for the project. It will include details such as data flow diagrams, API endpoints, database schemas, and other architectural considerations. This ensures a solid technical foundation before implementation begins.

3.  **`tasks.md`**: This document will break down the implementation work into a checklist of concrete coding tasks. These tasks will be sequential and logical, providing a clear roadmap for development.

By adhering to this structured approach, we aim to:
- Ensure a shared understanding of the goals and the plan.
- Maintain high-quality, well-documented code.
- Allow for efficient and scalable development.
