# Requirements

This document outlines the requirements for the Golang standalone authentication server.

## 1. User Stories

### 1.1. Core Authentication

*   **As a user, I want to be able to register for a new account using my email and password, so that I can access the service.**
*   **As a user, I want to be able to log in with my email and password, so that I can access my account.**
*   **As a system, I want to issue a JSON Web Token (JWT) upon successful login, so that the user can make authenticated requests to other services.**

### 1.2. Identity Provider Integration

*   **As a corporate user, I want to be able to log in using my company's LDAP credentials, so that I don't have to manage a separate account.**
*   **As a user, I want to be able to log in using my Google account, so that I can have a quick and easy sign-in experience.**

### 1.3. Security & Account Management

*   **As a user, I want to be able to reset my password if I forget it, so that I can regain access to my account.**
*   **As a system, I want to securely store user passwords by hashing and salting them, to protect user credentials.**

## 2. Acceptance Criteria

*   The server must expose endpoints for registration, login, and password reset.
*   The server must successfully authenticate users against a local database (for email/password), an LDAP server, and Google's OAuth 2.0 service.
*   Successful authentication must return a valid JWT.
*   Passwords must never be stored in plaintext.
*   The system should be configurable to enable or disable different identity providers.
