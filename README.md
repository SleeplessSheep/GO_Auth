# OIDC Identity Provider - Security & DevOps Showcase

A production-ready OpenID Connect Identity Provider built in Go, demonstrating enterprise-grade security patterns and modern DevOps practices. This project showcases both deep security knowledge and comprehensive cloud-native deployment capabilities.

## üéØ Project Goals

**Security Learning**: Hands-on implementation of OAuth 2.1/OIDC standards, cryptographic key management, multi-factor authentication, and security testing with penetration testing tools.

**DevOps Showcase**: Complete CI/CD pipeline with multi-environment deployments, Infrastructure as Code, monitoring, and cloud-native architecture patterns.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

- **Go-based Auth Server**: OIDC-compliant with RS256 JWT signing and automatic key rotation
- **Multi-Provider Authentication**: Local credentials, Google OAuth, and LDAP with role-based separation
- **Security-First Design**: Argon2 password hashing, mandatory PKCE, encrypted key storage, and comprehensive 2FA
- **Cloud-Native**: Kubernetes-native with Redis sessions, PostgreSQL persistence, and Prometheus monitoring

## üöÄ Three-Stage Deployment Pipeline

### Stage 1: Local Development (Minikube)
- Complete Kubernetes stack running locally
- Docker Compose for rapid development
- Local DNS and self-signed certificates
- Integrated security testing tools

### Stage 2: Cloud Production (Cloudflare Domain)
- Managed Kubernetes cluster (GKE/EKS/AKS)
- Automatic TLS with Let's Encrypt
- Cloudflare DNS integration
- Production monitoring and alerting

### Stage 3: AWS Enterprise
- Full AWS-native deployment with EKS
- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
- AWS services integration (RDS, ElastiCache, KMS)
- Advanced security and compliance features

## üîê Security Features

- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: TOTP-based with different enforcement levels
- **Role-Based Access**: Clear separation between users and administrators
- **Key Management**: Hybrid encryption model with automatic rotation
- **Security Testing**: Automated SAST/DAST scanning and penetration testing procedures
- **Compliance**: Security headers, rate limiting, and comprehensive audit logging

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

**Backend**: Go, Gin, GORM, golang-migrate  
**Security**: Argon2, RS256 JWT, TOTP, OAuth 2.1/OIDC  
**Infrastructure**: Kubernetes, Docker, Redis, PostgreSQL  
**DevOps**: GitHub Actions, Terraform, Helm, Prometheus, Grafana  
**Cloud**: GCP/AWS/Azure, Cloudflare, Let's Encrypt
